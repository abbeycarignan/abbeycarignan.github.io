<p><h3>Welcome to my life!</p></h3> </center>

<h3><p>I'm a first-year student at the University of Maine, and a recent high school graduate of Thornton Academy. Here's a little about me: I grew up my whole life in Saco, Maine. I have two siblings, a brother, and a sister. My oldest sibling Alyssa is a graduate from the University of Farmington, and is now an elementary school teacher. My older brother Andrew is a recent graduate from the University of Maine and now works at Wex. I have two parents that I love very much. Last but not least, my thirteen year old yellow labrador retriever named Jake who is one of my best friends.  As you will soon learn I love playing soccer, adventuring, and competing in track & field.</p><h3>
 


My Hobbies Include: Working out, playing soccer, going to the beach, reading, shopping, and anything involving nature.
