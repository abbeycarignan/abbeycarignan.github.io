		<center><p> Track & Field holds a special place in my heart, especially because I walked onto the track team here at the University of Maine. I'm honored to represent the University of Maine, and I'm putting in 100% effort everyday because I want to be the best me possible and make my school proud at the same time. To most people track seems like a very individualized sport, but to me it's all about family. Whether it's pushing each other in a workout or picking someone up when they have a bad meet that's what track is all about. Some accomplishments of mine have included placing third my senior year in long jump at our conference championships, placing sixth my sophomore year  at conference championships in the 300 hurdles, and being in Thornton Academy's top ten best female long jumpers.</center><p></h3>
