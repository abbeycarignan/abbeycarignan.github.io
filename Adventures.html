<center><h3><p> Firstly, I'm utterly obsessed with goats, and Mr. Hall a teacher at my high school has a goat farm. So, one afternoon my friend Taylor and I decided to drive up to Sunflower Farms in Cumberland to visit the baby goats. It was an amazing experience, the babies are only a few days old and they're jumping around and running every which way. It's adorable, especially when they fall asleep in your arms it's so precious.</center></h3></p>

<center><h3><p>  I recently went to Peaks Island, it's about a twenty minute ferry ride from Portland. This photo is the instead of Battery Steele, an army fortification built on the island in 1942 for WW II. The whole island itself is an easy bike ride with restaurants, beaches, tourists ventures, and it's definitely a great way to spend a summer day in Maine.</center></h3></p>

<center><h3><p>   Thirdly, every summer I go up to my friend Abbi's camp. We call it "UPTA CAMP" and when we are up there we go swimming, tubing, boating, waterskiing, make s'mores, and play board games. It's a classical camp life, and I look forward to it every summer! </center></h3></p>

<center><h3><p>  Summer of 2015 I saw Taylor Swift live at Gillette Stadium. We had floor seats, and it was an amazing experience, she was so personable when she was talking to the audience, which took me by surprise. Overall it was a an amazing night with some of my best friends; Taylor, Meaghan, and Kaitlyn.
