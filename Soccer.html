<h3><p> "The secret is to believe in your dreams; in your potential that you can be like your star, keep searching, keep believing and don't lose faith in yourself" -Neymar </p>		

<p> 	I've been playing soccer since I was five years old, growing up I always played in the back field, rotating between center back and outside back. Next I grew up playing on my local town team, then as I got older I started to play for premier soccer clubs. The first club team I played for was The Velocity Soccer Club, we weren't the best team statistically but I learned so much through my defensive coach Bryan and he definitely shaped me into the defender I am today. After that I started playing for Seacoast United and the recruiting aspect, but more importantly the technical side of the game. Last but certainly not least my four years of high school soccer led to the most memories, friendships, and victories any teammate could ask for, and that's why I love the game.</h3> </p>
